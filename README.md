Real Estate Price Prediction with Machine Learning

Welcome to the future of machine learning in real estate. In this project, I have designed and trained a machine learning model to predict real house prices within a specified area.

By leveraging robust training and testing methods, the model accurately predicts house prices based on user inputs such as property size (in square meters),
number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other key features. 
This project showcases the potential of AI in providing precise, data-driven property valuations.
I even went one step further by creating a web application for this project. The app allows users to easily input property details, 
such as square meters, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms, and receive instant price predictions. 
This user-friendly interface makes it accessible for anyone looking to get accurate, data-driven estimates of real estate prices in their area.
